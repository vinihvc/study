excerpt: Find the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence
description: Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence (not necessarily contiguous).
difficulty: hard

Write a function that finds the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in an array. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## How to Solve

Use dynamic programming with binary search. Maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the smallest tail element of all increasing subsequences of length `i+1`. For each number, use binary search to find where it should be placed. This optimizes from O(n²) to O(n log n).

## Code

```ts
const lengthOfLIS = (nums: number[]): number => {
  // Your implementation here
};
```

## Test Cases

### Input 1
```ts
const nums1 = [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18];
```

**Expected Output:** `4` (The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101] or [2, 3, 7, 18])

### Input 2
```ts
const nums2 = [0, 1, 0, 3, 2, 3];
```

**Expected Output:** `4` (The longest increasing subsequence is [0, 1, 2, 3])

### Input 3
```ts
const nums3 = [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7];
```

**Expected Output:** `1` (All elements are the same, so the longest subsequence has length 1)

## Complexity

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n) - We iterate through n elements, and for each we perform a binary search which is O(log n).

**Space Complexity:** O(n) - We maintain a dp array of size at most n.

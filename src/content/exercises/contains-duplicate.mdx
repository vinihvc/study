title: Contains Duplicate
excerpt: Check if array contains any duplicate values
description: Given an integer array, determine if any value appears at least twice in the array.
difficulty: easy
solved: false
---

Write a function that returns `true` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and `false` if every element is distinct.

## How to Solve

Use a Set to track seen numbers. As you iterate through the array, if a number is already in the set, return true. Otherwise, add it to the set. If you finish iterating without finding duplicates, return false.

## Code

```ts
const containsDuplicate = (nums: number[]): boolean => {
  // Your implementation here
};
```

## Test Cases

### Input 1
```ts
const nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 1];
```

**Expected Output:** `true` (1 appears twice)

### Input 2
```ts
const nums2 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
```

**Expected Output:** `false` (all elements are distinct)

### Input 3
```ts
const nums3 = [1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 2];
```

**Expected Output:** `true` (multiple duplicates exist)

## Complexity

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - We iterate through the array once, and Set operations (add, has) are O(1) on average.

**Space Complexity:** O(n) - In the worst case, the Set stores all n elements before finding a duplicate.

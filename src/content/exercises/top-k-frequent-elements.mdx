Write a function that returns the k most frequent elements from an array. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

## How to Solve

First, count the frequency of each element using a hash map. Then, use a min-heap (priority queue) of size k to keep track of the top k elements, or sort the entries by frequency and take the top k. Alternatively, use bucket sort for O(n) solution.

## Code

```ts
const topKFrequent = (nums: number[], k: number): number[] => {
  // Your implementation here
};
```

## Test Cases

### Input 1
```ts
const nums1 = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3];
const k1 = 2;
```

**Expected Output:** `[1, 2]` (1 appears 3 times, 2 appears 2 times)

### Input 2
```ts
const nums2 = [1];
const k2 = 1;
```

**Expected Output:** `[1]`

### Input 3
```ts
const nums3 = [4, 1, -1, 2, -1, 2, 3];
const k3 = 2;
```

**Expected Output:** `[-1, 2]` (both appear 2 times, 4, 1, and 3 appear once)

## Complexity

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - Bucket sort approach: count frequencies O(n), bucket sort O(n), collect results O(k). Heap approach: O(n log k).

**Space Complexity:** O(n) - Hash map stores at most n unique elements, and buckets array is size n.

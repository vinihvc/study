title: Group Anagrams
excerpt: Group strings that are anagrams of each other
description: Given an array of strings, group the anagrams together. An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word.

Write a function that groups all anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase.

## How to Solve

Use a hash map where the key is a sorted version of each string (or a character frequency signature), and the value is an array of anagrams. Iterate through the input array, sort each string to create a key, and add the original string to the corresponding group.

## Code

```ts
const groupAnagrams = (strs: string[]): string[][] => {
  // Your implementation here
};
```

## Test Cases

### Input 1
```ts
const strs1 = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"];
```

**Expected Output:** `[["bat"], ["nat", "tan"], ["ate", "eat", "tea"]]` (or any order of groups)

### Input 2
```ts
const strs2 = [""];
```

**Expected Output:** `[[""]]`

### Input 3
```ts
const strs3 = ["a"];
```

**Expected Output:** `[["a"]]`

## Complexity

**Time Complexity:** O(n * k log k) - Where n is the number of strings and k is the average length. We sort each string (k log k) and iterate through n strings.

**Space Complexity:** O(n * k) - We store all strings in the hash map, which requires space for n strings of average length k.

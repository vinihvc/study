title: Valid Anagram
excerpt: Check if two strings are anagrams
description: Given two strings, determine if they are anagrams (contain the same characters with the same frequencies).
difficulty: easy
solved: false
---

Write a function that takes two strings and returns `true` if they are anagrams of each other, and `false` otherwise. An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word, using all the original letters exactly once.

## How to Solve

Count character frequencies in both strings. If the strings have different lengths, they can't be anagrams. Use a hash map to count characters in the first string, then decrement counts while iterating the second string. If all counts reach zero, they're anagrams. Alternatively, sort both strings and compare.

## Code

```ts
const isAnagram = (s: string, t: string): boolean => {
  // Your implementation here
};
```

## Test Cases

### Input 1
```ts
const s1 = "anagram";
const t1 = "nagaram";
```

**Expected Output:** `true`

### Input 2
```ts
const s2 = "rat";
const t2 = "car";
```

**Expected Output:** `false`

### Input 3
```ts
const s3 = "listen";
const t3 = "silent";
```

**Expected Output:** `true`

## Complexity

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - Hash map approach: iterate both strings once. Sorting approach: O(n log n) due to sorting.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) - Hash map stores at most 26 characters (for lowercase English letters), which is constant space. Sorting approach: O(1) if sorting in-place, or O(n) if creating new arrays.

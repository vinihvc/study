title: Maximum Subarray
excerpt: Find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum
description: Given an integer array, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
difficulty: medium
solved: false

Write a function that finds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray. This is also known as Kadane's algorithm problem.

## How to Solve

Use Kadane's algorithm: iterate through the array, maintaining the maximum sum ending at the current position. At each step, decide whether to extend the previous subarray or start a new one. Keep track of the global maximum.

## Code

```ts
const maxSubArray = (nums: number[]): number => {
  // Your implementation here
};
```

## Test Cases

### Input 1
```ts
const nums1 = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4];
```

**Expected Output:** `6` (The subarray [4, -1, 2, 1] has the largest sum)

### Input 2
```ts
const nums2 = [1];
```

**Expected Output:** `1`

### Input 3
```ts
const nums3 = [5, 4, -1, 7, 8];
```

**Expected Output:** `23` (The entire array has the largest sum)

## Complexity

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - Single pass through the array.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) - Only use a few variables to track current and maximum sums.

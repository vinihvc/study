title: Merge Intervals
excerpt: Merge overlapping intervals
description: Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i], merge all overlapping intervals and return an array of non-overlapping intervals.
difficulty: medium
solved: false

Write a function that merges all overlapping intervals. An interval [a, b] overlaps with [c, d] if there is some real number x such that a ≤ x ≤ b and c ≤ x ≤ d.

## How to Solve

Sort intervals by start time. Iterate through sorted intervals, merging consecutive intervals if the current interval's start is less than or equal to the previous interval's end. Otherwise, add the previous merged interval to the result and start a new one.

## Code

```ts
const merge = (intervals: number[][]): number[][] => {
  // Your implementation here
};
```

## Test Cases

### Input 1
```ts
const intervals1 = [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]];
```

**Expected Output:** `[[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]` ([1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merged to [1,6])

### Input 2
```ts
const intervals2 = [[1, 4], [4, 5]];
```

**Expected Output:** `[[1, 5]]` (adjacent intervals are merged)

### Input 3
```ts
const intervals3 = [[1, 4], [0, 4]];
```

**Expected Output:** `[[0, 4]]` ([0,4] completely contains [1,4])

## Complexity

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n) - Sorting takes O(n log n), then a single O(n) pass to merge.

**Space Complexity:** O(n) - In the worst case, no intervals merge, so we store all n intervals in the result array.
